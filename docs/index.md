# Welcome to the Unofficial Ryver API Docs!

This project aims to document the Ryver API for developers. This is not
an official Ryver documentation, and is likely to be incomplete.

Ryver's API is built around the OData.org protocol. You can write
queries for a number of purposes, including getting data about forums
and users. However, a huge drawback is the lack of an alternative to 
HTTP Basic Authentication.

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to send a PR to the 
[GitHub repo](http://github.com/MD678685/UnofficialRyverDocs/).
